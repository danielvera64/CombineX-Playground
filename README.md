# CombineX Playground

A playground to test [CombineX](https://github.com/cx-org/CombineX). CombineX is an open-source implementation of Apple's Combine.

## Features

- I used the playground from [CombineSwiftPlayground](https://github.com/AvdLee/CombineSwiftPlayground) to test CombineX.
- The ‚ùå  mark on  some pages means that CombineX is not working. I didn't research if  the feature is not supported or there is an equivalent in CombineX.

## Installation

Dowload this repo and open `CombineXPlayground.xcworkspace`
